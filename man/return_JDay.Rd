\title{Returns Julian Day (with fraction)}
\usage{
return_JDay(index, Jday_vec, year_vec)
}
\arguments{
\item{index}{integer, when heat requirement is met}

\item{Jday_vec}{vector of julian days}

\item{year_vec}{vector with the year}
}
\value{
day of the year, with a fraction to account for when (at which hour)
the requirement is met. 12:00 midday corresponds to .0, in the afternoon up to +0.5 is added to the julian day, 
if it is before midday up to -0.5 is added to the Julian Day
